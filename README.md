## Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize data from the AdventureWorks database. The primary focus is on connecting and shaping data, data cleaning, relational data modeling, creating calculated fields with DAX, and visualizing data with detailed reports.

## Data Source
The data utilized in this project is sourced from the AdventureWorks database by Maven Analytics
## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Power BI**: Used for building the dashboard and visualizations.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Employed for custom calculations and measures.

## Key Functionalities
1. **Connecting & Shaping Data**: Utilizes Power Query with various data connectors for data transformation and profiling.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Focuses on removing null values, duplicates, and unnecessary columns, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
3. **Relational Data Modeling**: Involves creating robust data models using fact and dimension tables, understanding star schemas, and relationship cardinality.
4. **Calculated Fields with DAX**: Uses DAX for developing calculated columns and measures for in-depth data analysis.
5. **Visualizing Data with Reports**: Implements best practices in data visualization to create interactive and AI-enhanced reports and dashboards.
